# GMC-AI-question-generator
The whole project is hosted in the cloud, if you're one of the judges for GMC hackathon, you can find SSH creds in the presentation and thus you can read the src code from there. 

The initial text was taken from Gmc course : example.pdf 
You can find generated questions here : http://20.163.76.142/
> The hosting machine will be down just after the judges complete the project review.

This feature is based on Questgen AI
