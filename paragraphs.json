    "Difference between UX and UI: User interface design (UI) is the design of user interfaces for different software or machines with a clear purpose: to make a better experience for users when navigating through your platform. The main focus is to clarify the usability of various tools and also create a great aspect. The UI designer job is to make things as simple as possible, with clear and well-defined elements, such as buttons, icons, typography, and colors. The goal of user interface design is to make the user’s interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design: UCD).",
    "UX and UI: Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. UX design refers to the term 'user experience design', while UI stands for 'user interface design'. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together.",
    "UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces. UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive elements. UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is specific to digital products and experiences",
    "We can describe User Interface Design as the things users see when navigating a digital product and User Experience Design as the feeling they have while doing that. These two, are definitely different but they must work hand in hand for an aesthetic and intuitive interface. This is the reason why we can’t compare UI and UX Design and we must think of them as a whole process that leads to the final product: giving people the experience of using a beautiful website, apps or software while being on a journey of meeting their goals.",
